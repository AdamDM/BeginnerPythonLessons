1. Comments and Printing
2. Types and Variables

5. Booleans and Conditionals
6. Challenges

## Setup

Setting up Python to run locally could take a lot of time so for this session
it is recommended that you run things in a browser runner: http://skulpt.org/
Simply past the lines you want to run, hit run, and see the output on the box
to the right.

If you want to have better error messages then feel free to set up Python on 
your machine instead - I'd recommend https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual-d

## Teaching structure

This is more of a hands on lesson than a lecture, you'll be working through the 
exercises yourselves while I go around and offer help where possible. I will
occasionally get everyone's attention to go over something, but you need to 
do the work yourselves to understand what's going on.
