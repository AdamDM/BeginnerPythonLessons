# Mathematical Operations

# Python can take instructions about calculations of integers and floats, and resolve the answer

# The '+' and '-' operators do addition and subtraction
print(5 + 10)  # prints 15
print(5 - 10)  # prints -5

# The '*' and '/' operators perform multiplication and division
print(3 * 4)  # prints 12
print(20 / 5)  # prints 4.0

# The '%' operator performs a division but then returns the remainder only
print(5 % 2)  # prints 1. 5 divided by 2 is 2 with 1 remainder, so the remainder is printed
print(92 % 3)  # prints 2

# You can perform these operations within the code, including when you assign a variable
my_answer = 5 * 3
print(my_answer)  # prints 15 because the variable 'my_answer' is holding the value 15

# You can combine operations and variables
first_value = 23
second_value = 49
result = first_value + second_value
print(result)
